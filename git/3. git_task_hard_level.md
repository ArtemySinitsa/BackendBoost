### Hard Level

1.1. Create new repo and attach this repo to your local repo, your repo should have 2 remote repos<br/>
1.2. Create new branch with few commits and push it to your both remote repos<br/>
1.3. Remove first repo in your local repo<br/>
1.4. Create merge conflict on two branches whatever you wish and resolve it
_maybe for this it will be easier to create new branches_<br/>
1.5. Create two new branches with few commits and after that create a branch,
collect on this branch commits from two previously created branches
in a checkerboard pattern, one commit from one branch, then a commit
from another branch, in the order they were created <br/>
