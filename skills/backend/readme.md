# Backend overview

## Description

Backend refers to the logic and functions that happen behind the scenes but is necessary for the user to be able to send and receive information back and forth between the frontend and the database. Often used for server-side rendering as opposed to client-side rendering which is processed by the frontend, both of the elements work in tandem to provide for a well-functioning and efficient application. Backend developers build the “under the hood” parts of websites or mobile apps that users don’t interact with directly. This means that a back-end developer must be able to write code to receive the information input from the user and also save it somewhere – like in a database (relational or non relational).

It includes all the code needed to build out the database, server, and application.
From database migrations to API integrations to setting up the server-side technologies that make a website tick.
